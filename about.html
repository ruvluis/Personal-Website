    <h3>Coding</h3>
    
        <p>I am excited to share my coding experiences, which have been a journey of learning and growth. I started my coding journey 6 months ago, I am currently a student
        going for my BS in Computer Science, the Fullstack Academy Bootcamp offered by Amazon has also helped me expand my knowledge, and I am currently testing on phase 3
        of the ATA Program for Amazon. 
        This program introduced me to the world of coding and helped me gain a basic understanding of various programming 
        languages such as HTML, CSS, C#, and Python. I learned how to build web applications and create dynamic user interfaces using these languages.
        Since then, I have continued to learn and expand my coding skills by attending school and taking additional online courses. I have been able to dive deeper into specific 
        languages such as CSS and Python, learning advanced techniques and applications. I have also been able to develop my problem-solving skills and learn how to 
        approach complex coding challenges in a logical and efficient way. The more I learn about coding, the more I realize how vast and exciting this field can be. I am looking 
        forward to continuing to grow my skills and exploring new technologies in the future.</p>
        
    <h3>Process Assistant</h3>

        <P>As a Process Assistant for Amazon, I feel a great sense of responsibility in managing the department Inbound dock. Being the heart 
        of the operation, it is crucial to ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. It is a challenging role, but one that I find extremely rewarding. 
        I take pride in knowing that the work we do here directly affects downstream departments, and ultimately the customers we serve.
        Managing over 50 associates is no easy feat, but I have developed strategies to ensure that each one of them is strategically staffed. This not only ensures
         that we do not encounter any barriers in our department, but it also creates a positive and supportive work environment. 
        I make sure that my team members feel heard, appreciated, and empowered to make suggestions and improvements that will benefit the team as a whole.
        Every day at work is different, and that's what keeps me excited and engaged in my role as a Process Assistant. Whether it's troubleshooting an issue 
        on the inbound dock, working on process improvements, or coaching team members to help them reach their full potential, I know that I am making a difference 
        in the success of the department and the overall operation.</P>
