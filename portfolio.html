          <h3>Fullstack Academy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal Website:</li>
            <p>: As a Fullstack Academy student, I developed a personal website to showcase my skills, experiences, and hobbies. 
              The website serves as a platform for me to display my professional work and projects. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
              to design and create the website from scratch. This project allowed me to learn how to build a website from start to finish,
              including website design, front-end development, and back-end development.</p>
            <li>Zoo Procure:</li>
            <p>This project was also developed during my time at Fullstack Academy. Zoo Procure is a comprehensive list of animals with their 
              names and personal details, and it's designed to help individuals learn more about the different types of animals and their unique 
              characteristics. I used React and Redux to build this application, and I also incorporated an API that allowed me to gather information 
              about each animal. This project allowed me to further develop my skills in front-end development and gain experience in using APIs.</p>

          <h3>Amazon</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>HC Staffing Project:</li>
            <p> During my time at Amazon, I worked on the HC Staffing Project, which involved developing a strategic staffing model for a support department
              focused on quality assurance. The project involved analyzing workforce data and implementing innovative staffing solutions to optimize productivity,
               resulting in an estimated $1.2 million in annual savings. I used data analysis and modeling tools such as Excel, Python, and SQL to develop this solution. 
               This project allowed me to further develop my skills in data analysis and modeling, and also gave me experience in working on large-scale business projects.</p>
            <li>DPMO Tracker</li>
            <p>The DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunity) Tracker is a project I created during my time at Amazon. The project involved gathering information from different Amazon 
              sites to track associate errors and specify those errors to better help associates overcome their barriers and improve their performance. I used Excel and VBA to build 
              this tracker, which allowed me to easily analyze and manage data across different Amazon sites. This project allowed me to further develop my skills in data analysis and
               management, and also gave me experience in developing solutions for large-scale organizations.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Expense Structure</li>
            <p>At JWL Construction, I created an Excel listing that generates detailed expense reports for the company. This project helps the organization to keep track of all expenses,
               including those associated with construction, and maintain a transparent record of financial transactions. I used Excel and VBA to develop this solution, which allowed me 
               to automate the process of generating expense reports and make the process more efficient. This project allowed me to further develop my skills in data management and automation, 
               and also gave me experience in working on projects related to finance and accounting.</p>
